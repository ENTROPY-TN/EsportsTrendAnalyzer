## How HypeHunter Works

HypeHunter leverages advanced data aggregation and AI-driven analytics to identify trending games and deliver actionable insights to gamers, streamers, and developers. The system‚Äôs workflow is structured as follows:

1. Data Collection

We systematically gather raw data from multiple trusted sources via APIs:

RAWG API ‚Äì Provides detailed game metadata.

Twitter API ‚Äì Captures social media buzz and trending discussions.

Reddit API ‚Äì Monitors subreddit posts and comments in relevant gaming communities.

Twitch API ‚Äì Collects live viewer statistics for streaming content.

Steam API ‚Äì Retrieves player metrics, achievements, and game statistics.

This multi-source approach ensures comprehensive coverage of gaming trends across platforms.

2. Trending Game Identification

A dedicated intelligent agent scans subreddit activity, analyzing posts and comments to generate a preliminary list of potentially trending games. This candidate list is the foundation for deeper evaluation.

3. Data Aggregation

The candidate games are then queried across all APIs to collect relevant structured and unstructured data, including social engagement metrics, user statistics, and gameplay information.

4. Information Processing

Collected data is processed using our proprietary large language model, Gemnai Flash 2.0, which standardizes raw input into structured JSON objects. Each object contains detailed, multi-dimensional information about the game, including gameplay metrics, social engagement, and critical reception.

5. Rating System

A secondary LLM evaluates each game against a comprehensive multi-factor scoring framework:

Metric	Thresholds	Score
Rating	‚â• 4	5
	2 < rating ‚â§ 4	3
	‚â§ 2	1
Playtime (hours)	‚â• 100	5
	50 < playtime ‚â§ 100	3
	‚â§ 50	1
YouTube Views	‚â• 1M	5
	100K < views ‚â§ 1M	3
	‚â§ 100K	1
Twitch Viewer Count	‚â• 1000	5
	100 < viewers ‚â§ 999	3
	‚â§ 100	1
Metacritic Score	‚â• 80	5
	60 < score ‚â§ 80	3
	‚â§ 60	1

This scoring system ensures that each game is evaluated holistically across popularity, engagement, and critical reception.

6. Database Storage

The processed JSON data, along with calculated ratings, are stored in a MongoDB database. This enables the frontend to dynamically fetch trending game information, ensuring users receive real-time, data-driven insights.
